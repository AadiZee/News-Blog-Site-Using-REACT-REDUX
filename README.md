I have created a simple news blog website. The posts are shown from a local json-server and a contact form is made using Formik  <br>
 <br>

    "axios"  
    "bootstrap"  
    "formik"  
    "moment"  
    "react-bootstrap"  
    "react-masonry-css"  
    "react-moment"

    "react-router-dom"  
    "react-toastify"  
    "redux"
